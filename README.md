# wk4_mon_pet_store
working with sinatra


Achieved:

I can create a pet store, view all stores and edit them but I cant add pets to them ... 
I looked at the quidditch one but i cant see why it not appearing. 
I practised a little bit of css. it not that jazzy.

Problems.
Get pets in store and ask about search engines again, and adding an image. 
Image is set to a string but not sure how to call it. 

Due to having a few problems with this, I printed out the quidditch one and annoted it with notes . Hopefully this will help.
